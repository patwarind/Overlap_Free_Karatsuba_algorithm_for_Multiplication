# Overlap_Free_Karatsuba_algorithm_for_Multiplication
 Implementation of Overlap Free Karatsuba Algorithm for polynomial multiplication i.e. Finite field multiplier


In this project, Overlap Free Karatsuba algorithm for polynomial multiplication is synthesized and simulated in Xilinx Vivado 2019.2 using verilog HDL.
